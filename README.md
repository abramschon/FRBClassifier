This code is run in a virtual environment: 

To activate the virtual environment, type: `source .venv/bin/activate`

To deactivate the virtual environment, type: `deactivate`

There is also some illustrative scripts. For instance code that shows the results of applying a *convolutional filter*, and code that shows the results of applying a *maxpooling layer*.
